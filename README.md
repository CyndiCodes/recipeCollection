# Recipe Book - An Interactive MERN Application

## Our Task

Real-World problems need real-world solutions and as full-stack developers it is our goal to provide solutions that are efficient and advantageous for users. This is our first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application and we used some cutting edge and up to date technology to build a user-focused platform. Some of the tools we used were back end technologies like MongoDB, GraphQL API, Node.js, and Express.js and front end technologies like React, and a user authenticator called JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Our objective was to used incorporate agile method of work flow by using GitHub, managing the project with Kanban boards and WireFrames, and implementing GitFlow efficiencies like clean branches for each feature helping troubleshooting for bug fixes and pull requests. As a group we have utilized many great skills that we have learned throughout this course and aimed it at a real-world problem in order to not only demonstrate our problem-solving skills but also leverage our newly acquired knowledge to add a well polished portfolio piece. 

The following application embodies a multitude of features that meet the requirements that were put in place for this assignment. As you explore this application you will see a well polished UI on a site that was deployed onto Heroku with live data being served up by React components tested with GraphQL, MongoDB and seeded using Mongoose ODM database. This site is responsive and interactive with the intention of protecting sensitive information using API keys and web tokens for user sessions. You will also see a clean repository that meets quality coding standards like naming convention and file structure and of course this high-quality README to explain in detail what this project has materialized into.
